This project involved creating an Imaging Processor application in Qt Creator using C++. The project allowed the user to select a .JPEG image to be uploaded to a FPGA board via a UDP connection. Upon being uploaded, the user is able to control the image's brightness and contrast via GUI sliders using pixel RGB manipulation.
